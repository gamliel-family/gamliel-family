            until recently, when Professor Bairstone and Dr Ruby Day,
            an excellent scientist, stumbled across it in an expedition in Siberia to find prehistoric fossils. They were exploring a
            cave when Ernest, Bairstones dog, started barking and sniffing at a large rock. They found a box hidden in a
            crack in the boulder. When Bairstone opened it he saw the jewel.</em>
