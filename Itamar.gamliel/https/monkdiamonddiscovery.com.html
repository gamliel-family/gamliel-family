The Monk Diamond has stayed hidden until recently, when Professor Bairstone and Dr Ruby Day, an excellent scientist, stumbled across it in an expedition in Siberia to find prehistoric fossils. They were exploring a cave when Ernest, Bairstones dog, started barking and sniffing at a large rock. They found a box hidden in a crack in the boulder. When Bairstone opened it he saw the jewel.
